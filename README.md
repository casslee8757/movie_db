3. Movie detail page <br>
You can see the details of the movie on this page. If you want to explore the filmography of the director and casts, you can simply click their name and it will direct you to the page where you can see the list of their movies. I have placed 2 rating systems in the 'Movie Info', the first rating is from the movie rating website and the second rating is the average of the users rating. Just below the 'movie info' section is the user review section and this is another feature for logged in users.
